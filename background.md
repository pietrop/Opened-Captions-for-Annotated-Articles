NPR [developed the original system](https://twitter.com/eads/status/780578980957151232), [open sourced the code](https://github.com/nprapps/anno-docs), and [did a write up on source ](https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-npr-transcribes-and-fact-checks-debates-live/)  which was the starting point for Vox to re-think about [how to simplify the system](https://storytelling.voxmedia.com/2017/1/20/14329600/annotation-feature-vox).

We gather folks involved in this process in the hyperaud.io slack (a community slack for people interested in audio,video, captions and transcriptions on the web) in the 
`#opened_captions` channel to keep the knowledge share going. 

<!--
Once the version described in this guide was developed, parts of it were adopted by NPR, and a google doc plugin for making the annotations process more straightforward was developed.
