NPR [developed the original system](https://twitter.com/eads/status/780578980957151232), [open sourced the code](https://github.com/nprapps/anno-docs), and [did a write up on source ](https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-npr-transcribes-and-fact-checks-debates-live/)  which was the starting point for Vox to re-think about [how to simplify the system](https://storytelling.voxmedia.com/2017/1/20/14329600/annotation-feature-vox).

Initially considered speech to text services to deal with the video/audio live stream from `c-span`. 

After some research found the [opened caption service by Dan Schultz](/what-is-opened-captions.md), described in the next section.

We gather folks involved in this process in the hyperaud.io slack (a community slack for people interested in audio,video, captions and transcriptions on the web) in the 
`#opened_captions` channel to keep the knowledge share going.

Once the version described in this guide was developed, parts of it were adopted by NPR, and a google doc plugin for making the annotations process more straightforward was developed.
