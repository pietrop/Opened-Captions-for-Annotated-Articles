Original description of the session 

<!--Overview of the service and how to set it up -->
>##"Hands on: Live fact checking TV speeches in your google docs!"

>True or false?: Major political events are regularly covered on live TV, and all of them feature speakers with an agenda.

>When the lens of public attention shines on politicians it is important for journalists to be able to contextualize their messages as quickly and effectively as possible. During this session we will teach participants about open source tools that are being used today by live fact checkers to create annotated transcripts. They will learn about an open service called Opened Captions and how it can be used in conjunction with google doc to get real time transcriptions of political speeches.

>This is an hands on session, drawing on experience from Vox and NPR collaboration, participants will also be shown how to export the annotated speech from the google doc into a news article static web page, that could be ready for publication.
